# LibPacketParser
This project provides a C++ library that parses network packets and returns a list of pointers to the header for each layer. In other words, it's an extremely simple packet dissector.

## Rationale
I wanted an extremely small and fast packet dissetor for another project I was working on.

## Using
Add this project as a submodule to your project and then add the files to your build.

## License
This library is released under the MIT license, see LICENSE for details.
